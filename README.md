My name is Yuxing Wang (王昱兴). As a researcher in the Embodied Intelligence field, my passion lies in Robot Co-Design, Evolutionary Learning, and Large Models. I focus on the simultaneous coordination of brain (control), body (morphology), and environment (task) to design embodied agents that are not only structurally sound but also behaviorally adept ✨.

I received the B.Eng. degree from Southwest Minzu University, P.R. China, in 2020, and the M.Eng. degree from Tsinghua University, P.R. China, in 2023 (advised by Prof. Xueqian Wang). Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in Control Science and Engineering at Tsinghua University. My industry experience includes being a research intern at Tencent AI Lab from May 2022 to May 2023, where I collaborated with Shuang Wu and Haobo Fu. My internship was supported by the 2022 Tencent Rhino-Bird Research Elite Program, and my work focused on generating user-specified behavioral diversity for Game AI.

My favorite singer is Hikaru Utada. I also like watching comedies and talk shows. Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in my research or related ideas :smile:. 📫 Reach me through wyx20@tsinghua.org.cn
