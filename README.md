 <p style="text-align:justify;"> My name is Yuxing Wang (王昱兴). As a researcher in the Embodied Intelligence field, my passion lies in Robot Co-Design, Evolutionary Learning, and Large Models. I focus on the simultaneous coordination of brain (control), body (morphology), and environment (task) to design embodied agents that are not only structurally sound but also behaviorally adept.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> I received the B.Eng. degree from <a href="https://www.swun.edu.cn/">Southwest Minzu University</a>, P.R. China, in 2020, and the M.Eng. degree from <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/">Tsinghua University</a>, P.R. China, in 2023 (advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h9dN_ykAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN">Prof. Xueqian Wang</a>). Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in Control Science and Engineering at <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/">Tsinghua University</a>. My industry experience includes being a research intern at <a href="https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/">Tencent AI Lab</a> from May 2022 to May 2023, where I collaborated with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=_MtBmxkAAAAJ">Shuang Wu</a> and <a href="https://haobofu.github.io/">Haobo Fu</a>. My internship was supported by the 2022 Tencent Rhino-Bird Research Elite Program, and my work focused on generating user-specified behavioral diversity for Game AI.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> My favorite singer is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikaru_Utada">Hikaru Utada</a>. I also like watching comedies and talk shows.
